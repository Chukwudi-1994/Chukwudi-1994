# Profile

Data Analyst/Engineer working at Remote Leverage. Responsible for pulling data and making dashboards.

I have interest in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and pursue projects related to these fields in my spare time. I also enjoy building PCs, music and art.

This github account is used mainly to keep a track of modules for my Master's degree and wherever possibe share the code used in my various extracurricular projects.
