# Profile

Senior Data Scientist at the Ministry of Justice and part time Masters student (Data Science MSc) at Birkbeck College, University of London.

I have interest in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and pursue projects related to these fields in my spare time. I also enjoy building PCs, music and art.

This github account is used mainly to keep a track of modules for my Master's degree and wherever possibe share the code used in my various extracurricular projects.
